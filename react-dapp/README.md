# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

## Installation

1. Compile the Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

1. Start the hardhat local server

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

1. Deploy the Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
